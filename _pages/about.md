I am an Associate Professor of Empirical Software Engineering at the University of Zurich ([UZH](http://www.uzh.ch/en.html)), Switzerland, where I lead the Zurich Empirical Software engineering Team ([ZEST](http://www.ifi.uzh.ch/en/zest.html)).

My curriculum vitae (updated May 2021) is available [here]().

[comment]: # My research interests are in software engineering and human interactions, including programmer cognition, automated infrastructure, and software ecosystems. 

[comment]: # My research field is empirical software engineering. My broader vision is to move away from decisions based on intuition, or development activities painstakingly conducted manually, into solutions created using data-driven mathematical models, which make use of the large amount of information available during the software engineering process.

[comment]: # I did my Ph.D. under the supervision of Prof. Dr. [Michele Lanza](http://www.inf.usi.ch/faculty/lanza/), working in the REVEAL research group, at the Faculty of Informatics of the Universit&agrave; della Svizzera Italiana ([USI](http://www.usi.ch)). I have been intern twice (2012 and 2013) at [Microsoft Research](http://research.microsoft.com/) in Redmond, USA, working with Dr. [Christian Bird](http://cabird.com/).


[comment]: # I obtained my bachelor and master degrees in computer science from <a href="http://www.cs.unibo.it/en/" title="department of computer science, university of bologna">University of Bologna</a>, also studying one year at the <a href="http://www.ulb.ac.be/" title="Universit&eacute; Libre De Bruxelles">Universit&eacute; Libre De Bruxelles</a> during my Master. After obtaining the master degree, I have been working in the industry for one year at <a href="" title="Cineca">[Cineca](http://www.cineca.it/en)</a>, the largest Italian computing center.

  <p>My sister, <a href="http://impressioni.bo.it" title="Fotografo Matrimoni Bologna">Chiara Bacchelli</a>, is an exceptional photographer and her work focuses on weddings (or "matrimonio" as we say in Italian). Check out her photos on her own <a href="http://impressioni.bo.it" title="Fotografo Matrimoni Bologna">web site</a>&mdash;they are pretty awesome!</p>
